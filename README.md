# Pneumonia Detection Using Deep Learning

## Usage

**Run the Flask Application:**

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory where `app.py` is located.
3. Run the Flask application by executing the `app.py` script. This typically involves running `python app.py` or `python3 app.py` in the terminal, depending on your Python environment.

**Access the Web Interface:**

1. After starting the Flask application, it will typically provide a local URL where you can access the web interface. By default, Flask runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, but it may vary depending on your configuration.
2. Open your web browser and enter the URL in the address bar.

**Use the Web Interface:**

Once you've accessed the web interface, you can interact with it as designed. In your case, you mentioned that it's for pneumonia detection:
   - Upload an X-ray image for pneumonia detection.
   - The model will evaluate the image and provide the result.
   - Provide your current location.
   - The application will display nearby hospitals.

**Interact with the Application:**

- Follow the prompts and UI elements on your web interface to navigate through the process.

**Terminating the Application:**

- When you're done testing or using the application, you can typically stop the Flask application by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the Flask server is running. This will shut down the local web server.

## Code Structure

- `app.py`: The main application code.
- `model.h5`: The trained deep learning model.
- `templates/`: HTML templates for the web interface.
- `static/`: CSS files for styling.
